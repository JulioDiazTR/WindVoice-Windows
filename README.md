## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- Python 3.10+ (recommended: Python 3.11 or 3.12)
- Thomson Reuters LiteLLM API credentials

### Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Portable Executable (Recommended)

1. **Download or Build EXE**
   ```bash
   # Build portable executable
   pyinstaller WindVoice.spec --clean --noconfirm
   ```

2. **Run**
   - Navigate to `dist/` folder
   - Double-click `WindVoice-Windows.exe`
   - No installation required - runs immediately

> **Why EXE is recommended:** Due to organizational permission policies, MSI installers may install successfully but cannot be uninstalled without admin privileges, potentially leaving the system in a blocked state.

#### Option 2: MSI Installer (Alternative)

1. **Download or Build MSI**
   ```bash
   # Build MSI installer
   python build.py
   ```

2. **Install**
   - Double-click `installer/WindVoice-Windows-Installer.msi`
   - Follow installation wizard
   - Launch from Start Menu

> **Note:** MSI installation may require admin privileges for uninstallation. Use only if you have full admin access or prefer system integration.

#### Option 3: Python Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd WindVoice-Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Configuration

On first run, configure via the setup wizard or manually edit `%USERPROFILE%\.windvoice\config.toml`:

```toml
[litellm]
api_key = "sk-your-litellm-api-key"
api_base = "https://your-litellm-proxy.com"
key_alias = "your-username"
model = "whisper-1"
```

See the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLER_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## üéØ Usage

1. **Start WindVoice** - Application runs in system tray
2. **Press hotkey** - `Ctrl+Shift+Space` from any application
3. **Speak clearly** - Record your voice (visual feedback provided)
4. **Press hotkey again** - Stop recording
5. **Get text** - Auto-injected into active field or shown in popup

### Smart Behavior
